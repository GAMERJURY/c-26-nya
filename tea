To make a good cup of tea, 
start by putting 1 teaspoon of loose tea leaves or 1 bag of 
tea in your cup. Then, pour hot water over the tea until 
the cup is four-fifths of the way full. You can also add a 
splash of milk to enhance the flavor of your tea. If 
you're making green tea, let the tea steep for 1 minute.
